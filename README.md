# Personal Website for Adam Smith
This is a simple website with three pages: Landing, About, and Game. The contents of the nav and footer files are linked to by all three main pages. The objective of the game is to "catch" the grey dot by clicking on it. But you had better be quick, it jumps! There's a trick to it, and you may have to look at the JavaScript code to figure it out.

## External Styling Resources
* Color themes selected from: https://coolors.co/palettes/popular
* Fonts selected from: https://fonts.google.com/

## Requirements Accomplished
* A landing page, defined in index.html, which my viewers will land on. It lets people know what the site is about and contains the necessary links and navigation for people to get around the site.
* Multiple navigational elements, the header bar and footer bar make my site easy to navigate. There are no dead ends, and the user does not need to resort to the browser's navigation buttons to get where they want to go. Navigational elements do not scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is resized. Color and positioning of the navigational elements are styled in CSS.
* Three internal links. These are separate pages within my site. A landing page, a personal about me page, and a page with a game on it. The styling of the internal links match the styling of the rest of the site and the navigational elements are always present. Internal links open their content in the same browser tab as the site is being viewed in, just like the assignment links on our course web page.
* Multiple external links on the "about" page. The external links open new browser tabs so that my site remains open in the user's browser, same as the behavior of the Blackboard and Piazza links on our course website.
* One HTML table on the "about" page, with CSS styling. The table organizes the elements into columns and rows similarly to how the schedule on the landing page of our course website is an example of table layout. With CSS, I have controlled spacing, borders (and a lack of) and other visual aspects.
* Several interactive or animated components. I used jQuery and vanilla JS to give my website a little flair by having an animated navigation menu, interactive highlighting in the table on the about page (similar to the way the rows of the schedule on our class website turn gray when the mouse is over them), and an interactive game.
* Attention to responsiveness. My site behaves in a reasonable way when viewed on a desktop in a browser, and on a mobile device. I use CSS media queries to make sure that my site looks okay on different sized displays.
